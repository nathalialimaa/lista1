    </div>
        <p><span>Different versions of Word have different ways of saving these formatting styles on your computer. First, open this document on your computer.</span></p>
        <ul class="list-paragraph">
            <li><span class="garamond">If you are using Word 2010, select the Home tab, click on <span class="italic">Change Styles</span>, and then <span class="italic">Style Set</span>. Scroll to the bottom of the list of styles and select <span class="italic">Save as Quick Style Set</span>. Save these styles as a Quick Style Set giving it a meaningful name.</span></li>
            <li><span class="garamond">If you are using Word 2016, select the Design tab and click on the pull-down arrow at the right of the display of designs. Select <span class="italic">Save as New Style Set</span>. Save this style set, giving it a meaningful name.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>To attach the styles to a blank document or one that you have already created, do the following. Open the document.</span></p>
        <ul class="list-paragraph">
            <li><span class="garamond">If you are using Word 2010, select the Home tab, click on Change Styles, and then Style Set. The name you gave the style set should appear in the list. Click on it to attach it to your file.</span></li>
            <li><span class="garamond">If you are using Word 2016, select the Design tab and click on the pull-down arrow at the right of the display of designs. The Style Set you saved should appear under Custom. Click on the name to attach it to your document.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>If you don’t want to save the styles, save this document under a new name. Delete from the top of page 2 to the end. You will have the correct formatting for the first page and the paragraphs, as well as the paragraph styles and can copy and paste your paper into it.</span></p>
        <h1><span>General Information</span></h1>
        <p><span>Prepare your manuscript in Microsoft Word or export it from a different word processor into RTF format, following the specifications that we show here.</span></p>
        <p><span>For papers that deal with data analysis, make the data available to readers via a link you place in your paper to a website where you store your data, if at all possible. We can help.</span></p>
        <p><span>When you submit your paper for review, make sure that you have anonymized your paper by removing all references to yourself or your institution. Make sure these are removed from the document properties as well. To have your paper reviewed, you need first to submit a “blinded” version (without author or affiliation information) that can be blind reviewed. After your paper is accepted, add the author information.</span></p>
        <h2><span>Language and Grammar Consistency</span></h2>
        <p><span>We publish papers written in English. If you have questions on English grammar or punctuation, search the web for guidance. You can find excellent guides at </span><a href="http://www.grammarbook.com" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="Hyperlink">http://www.grammarbook.com</span></a><span> and </span><a href="http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="Hyperlink">http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar</span></a><span> </span></p>
        <p><span>While we prefer the use of U.S. spelling, we accept other versions of English as long as they are used consistently throughout the paper.</span></p>
        <h3><span>Use of the singular “they”</span></h3>
        <p><span>When the gender of a person is unknown, the use of the singular “they” is accepted. Do not use expressions such as “s/he” or “his or her.” </span><a id="_Hlk37057714"><span>For example, “Each student submitted their art portfolio to the committee” is correct. If using the singular “they” as a generic third-person pronoun seems awkward, try rewording the sentence or using the plural, such as “All students submitted their art portfolios to the committee” </span></a><span>or “The art portfolio of each student was submitted to the committee.” More information about this is at </span><a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="Hyperlink">https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/grammar/singular-they" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="Hyperlink">https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/grammar/singular-they</span></a><span class="aw-import-ignore">&#xa0;</span></p>
        <h1><span>Content</span></h1>
        <h2><span>First Page Layout</span></h2>
        <p><span>To put the first page of your document in the proper format, copy the content of the first page from this file into your document and fill in the abstract information.</span></p>
        <h3><span>Author information (</span><span style="text-decoration:underline">added after paper has been accepted</span><span>)</span></h3>
        
        <p>
            <span>Once the Editor has accepted your paper, insert the full name, the affiliation (University or Company), City, Country, and email address for each author into the table on the first page. Insert additional rows if there are more than two authors. If there is more than one author, place an asterisk after the corresponding author’s name.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>In the Author section at the end of the paper, add a short biography and a head-and-shoulders photo (if available) for each author.</span>
            <span class="aw-import-spaces">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span>
        </p>
        <h3><span>What to put in the abstract</span></h3>
        <p>
            <span class="text-underline">The abstract is a brief summary of the contents of the article; it should give enough information to make the reader want to learn more about your research,</span>
            <span>but it needs to be concise. In each of the boxes on the first page, enter one or two brief sentences appropriate for your paper. Omit citations from the abstract; citations for the paper’s sources do appear in the body of the paper.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>If any of the abstract subtopics do not apply to your paper, put “NA” in that box.</span></p>
        <h2><span>Body of Paper</span></h2>
        <h3><span>Introduction or background</span></h3>
        <p><span>All papers should begin with an introduction that sets the stage for the discussion. For some disciplines, it is more appropriate to use Background as an alternative first section.</span></p>
        <h3><span>Body</span></h3>
        <p><span>The body is a collection of multiple sections describing the main content of the paper. You should use up to three levels of headings to categorize content as deemed necessary: Heading 1, Heading 2, and Heading 3.</span></p>
        <h3><span>Conclusion</span></h3>
        <p><span>This section summarizes the paper, presents challenges, suggests future study, and so on to create a lasting impression of the paper.</span></p>
        <h3><span>Appendix</span></h3>
        <p><span>If there is an appendix, place it after the References and before the Biography. If there is more than one appendix, add a letter after “Appendix.” Appendices must be mentioned at the appropriate places within the body of the document.</span></p>
        <p><span>If you have used a questionnaire in a study, include a copy of it as an appendix.</span></p>
        <h3><span>References</span></h3>
        <p>
            <span>Following the conclusion is a list of all references used in the body of the paper. The current APA formatting guidelines are used to make internal citations within the body as well as provide the complete alphabetic list of reference citations at the end of the paper. (See the Entering References section for more details. We have placed a summary of these guidelines at </span>

            <span>) The References list contains </span><span style="font-weight:bold">only</span><span> works cited in the paper and </span><span style="font-weight:bold">all</span><span> works cited in the paper must be listed in the References section.</span>
        </p>
        <h2><span>Author Information with Picture</span></h2>
        <p>
            <span>After the paper is accepted, at the end of the paper, for each author please provide a one or two paragraph biography that describes the author’s background relevant to this article. If you have one, insert a head-and-shoulder photo to the left of the biography of each author or send it separately and we will insert it.</span>
        </p>
        <h1><span>Page Formatting</span></h1>
        <p><span>To make it easier to read the paper online, use single-column formatting for the paper.</span></p>
        <h2><span>Page Size</span></h2>
        <p><span>Set the paper size to Letter, which is 8 1/2 by 11 inches.</span></p>
        <h2><span>Margins</span></h2>
        <p><span>Set the top and bottom margins to 1 inch and the right and left margins to 1.25 inches.</span></p>
        <h2><span>Headers and Footers</span></h2>
        <p><span>Insert page numbers in the footer. We will add the remaining information for the headers and footers.</span></p>
        <h2><span>Hyphenation</span></h2>
        <p><span>Hyphenate the text in the document. To turn on hyphenation:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li class="list-paragraph"><span class="garamond">Select Language on the Layout or Page Layout menu.</span></li>
            <li class="list-paragraph"><span class="garamond">Select Hyphenation.</span></li>
            <li class="list-paragraph"><span class="garamond">Check Automatically hyphenate document.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h2><span>Footnotes</span></h2>
        <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Footnotes should not be used at all</span><span>. Insert your note within the body of the paper (if it is important) or omit it. The editors will remove footnotes and place the material within the text.</span></p>
        <h1><span>Paragraph Styles (This is a Heading 1 Style)</span></h1>
        <p><span>If you have not attached these styles to your paper, use Word’s default paragraph styles for your document, making just the changes indicated below.</span></p>
        <h2><span>Headings (This is a Heading 2 Style)</span></h2>
